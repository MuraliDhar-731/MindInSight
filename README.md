MedInSight-RAG is an end-to-end biomedical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to perform domain-grounded biomedical question-answering using:

BioBERT for embeddings

FAISS for dense similarity search

BioGPT, Flan-T5, and Phi-2 for generation

This project evaluates factual consistency, semantic accuracy, biomedical fluency, and reasoning depth across three LLMs within the same RAG pipeline.
